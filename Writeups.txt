                                                                           FINAL PROJECT



Here I'll use import java.io.file and import java.io.IOException for doing file operations and scanner for scanning the user inputs 
Then I'll use ifelse statement, switch statement, for loop and while loop
I'll sort my files using for loop then using switch statement I create ,search and delete a file here the scanner will retrieve the user inputs and check with the conditions
then will give some outputs.
This will help me to understand about the file operations then how to use multiple conditions using the loops and statements.
finally I push my code into git hub repository.
